{"name": "Comfy Clouds #66", "description": "Comfy Clouds : A handmade art project by an anonymous artist with no experience in creating digital art. Every Cloud has unique attributes that may not be perfect, but anons should be comfy knowing that all Cloud holders will be airdropped a piece of all future projects.\n\nWe are under the impression that our skills will improve over time and the art will provide utility, joy, and maybe some extra surprises for loyal holders and supporters. In the meantime, please enjoy your Comfy Cloud :)", "image": "ipfs://QmPQ28AaiANBZVMKnvdoXHmWNYDw7BX3LnkKupBtF3A8Vq/66.jpg", "attributes": [{"trait_type": "Cloud #", "value": "66"}, {"trait_type": "Background", "value": "Off-White"}, {"trait_type": "Cloud", "value": "White"}, {"trait_type": "Eyes", "value": "Closed"}, {"trait_type": "Mouth", "value": "Open"}, {"trait_type": "Accessory", "value": "Lollipop"}, {"trait_type": "Dimples", "value": "Yes"}, {"trait_type": "One Dimple", "value": "No"}, {"trait_type": "Nose", "value": "None"}, {"trait_type": "Tattoo", "value": "None"}, {"trait_type": "Special", "value": "None"}]}
